This is our implementation of Deadwood.

In order to run you must compile then run the Deadwood.java file in command line with no arguments.

Once in the Deadwood directory in your terminal you must type:

    javac *.java
After everything gets compiled you must type:
    
    java Deadwood.java

You will be prompted for a player count to play the game, from there it will pick a random player to start and you will be prompted to choose an option.

It is not fully implemented however we were able to get to a point where the game can run just without the players or cards visible on the board, we ended up having to pretty much completely redo the original implementation from the command line version. The shot counters are fully functional and will count down with each successful take.
